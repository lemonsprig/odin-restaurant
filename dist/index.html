            It may sound half baked, but you will be amazed at the flavour
            sensations that is possible, so come join us and open your pallette

            If you are feeling brave why not check out our signature desert,
            carmalised sprouts encased in choclate with a raspberry dippling
            coulis. You will either love it or hate it, but isn't that the case
            with sprouts? They are a firm favourite of ours and we hope they
            will become yours as well.
